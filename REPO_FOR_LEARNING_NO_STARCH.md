# Learning Repository

A collection of code experiments, algorithm implementations, and proof-of-concept projects used for learning computer science fundamentals and programming techniques.

## What's Here

This repository contains:

- **Algorithm implementations** - Data structures, sorting, searching, and optimization
- **Code experiments** - Testing new concepts and language features
- **POC projects** - Small-scale implementations to validate ideas
- **Practice problems** - Solutions to coding challenges and exercises

## Structure

```
Repo_for_learning/
├── algorithms/          # Algorithm implementations and analysis
├── data-structures/     # Custom DS implementations
├── experiments/         # Quick tests and prototypes
├── problems/           # Coding challenge solutions
└── projects/           # Mini learning projects
```

## Technologies

- **Python** - Primary language for algorithms and scripting
- **Java** - Object-oriented programming practice
- **C** - Systems programming and low-level concepts
- **Bash/PowerShell** - Shell scripting and automation

## Usage

Clone and explore:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptpatch/Repo_for_learning.git
cd Repo_for_learning

# Run examples
python algorithms/sorting/quicksort.py
java -cp . datastructures/BinaryTree.java
```

## Current Focus

- Implementing classic algorithms from scratch
- Understanding time/space complexity analysis
- Practicing design patterns
- Building foundational programming skills

## Notes

This is a learning repository. Code here prioritizes understanding over production quality. Each directory contains its own README with specific details about implementations and learnings.
